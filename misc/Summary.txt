This video shows a demonstration of the system presented in "Bayesian On-line of
Driving Behaviors". It displays 3 sequences of a car approaching a traffic light.
The label 7 is associated to all of them and the predicted action is a braking
maneuver (only x acceleration is printed here). The segment numbers also appear
on the frames and this shows the quality of the motion segmentation.
