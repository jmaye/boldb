In this paper, we have presented a novel approach to on-line learning of driving
behaviors. To this end, we have developed an entire Bayesian framework that is
able to learn and adapt to new situations. For computational and storage
purposes, we have approximated the full posterior distribution with a
Rao-Blackwellized particle filter. We have shown an original application of the
change-point detection model of~\cite{adams07bayesian} and
\cite{fearnhead07online} to the segmentation of IMU data with a clearer
formulation. Visual traffic situations models have been learned
probabilistically from images and linked to an action model from IMU data. Our
system is suitable for lifelong learning since it is able to continuously update
its models. We have conducted experiments on a challenging urban dataset and
validated our approach.

In the near future, we aim at improving our image representation with a more
sophisticated model. In particular, we want to consider images as an histogram
of objects rather than features. We aspire to determine which objects in the
scene influence an action. Our second mid-term goal is to deploy our system in
a car and have a real-time driving assistant.
