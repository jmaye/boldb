In this paper, we have presented a novel approach for on-line learning of
driving behaviors in an unsupervised fashion. To this end, we have developed an
entire Bayesian framework that is able to learn and adapt to new traffic
situations and drivers. Visual traffic situations models have been modeled
probabilistically from image streams and associated to motion segments from
IMU data. Potential actions related to a particular traffic scene are jointly
learned, providing predictions in unseen environments. Our system is suitable
for lifelong learning since it is able to continuously update its models. We
quantified the usefulness and the performance of this approach on a challenging
urban dataset.

In a further work, we aim at improving our image representation with a more
sophisticated model in order to determine which object in the scene induces
an action. Action modeling at a higher level could be represented with a Hidden
Markov Model (HMM).
