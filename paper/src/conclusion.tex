In this paper, we have presented a novel approach for on-line learning of driving
behaviors in an usupervised fashon. To this end, we have developed an entire Bayesian framework that is
able to learn and adapt to new traffic situations. For computational and storage
purposes, we have approximated the full posterior distribution with a
Rao-Blackwellized particle filter. Visual traffic situations models have been learned
probabilistically from image streams and associated to motion segments in IMU data. Our
system is suitable for lifelong learning since it is able to continuously update
its models. 
We quantified the usefulness and the performance of this approach on a challenging 
urban dataset.

% In the near future, we aim at improving our image representation with a more
% sophisticated model. We aim to determine which objects in the
% scene influence an action.

% In the near future, we aim at improving our image representation with a more

% a car and have a real-time driving assistant.
