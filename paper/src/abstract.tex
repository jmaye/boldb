One research area that has turned more and more into the focus of interest
during the last years is the development of driver intelligent assistant
systems. In particular, a very active topic is the design of human-friendly
vehicle control systems, able to meet the driver specific behaviors. In this
paper we address the problem of learning driver behaviors based on on camera
images and inertial information (IMU). Our approach proposes a novel on-line and
unsupervised way of learning driver's behavior in different traffic conditions.
Specifically we learn the relationship between vehicle motion and image streams.
In this paper we introduce a novel technique that uses a \textit{change-point}
detection model to segment IMU and image streams into portions corresponding to
behaviors. Change-point detection is the problem of detecting abrupt changes to
the parameters of a statistical model. This is computed on-line and in an
unsupervised manner. The results from experiments in populated urban
environments demonstrate the robustness of the algorithm to correctly identify
several driving behaviors.
